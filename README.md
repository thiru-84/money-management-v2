# Money Management App Project [CRED]

Creating a fully functional Income Expense Calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project will allow the users to add, edit, and delete income and expense entries,
provids an overview of their financial status. The project will implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage the data.

# Tech Used

HTML - Structure of the app.
Tailwind - Application Styling
JS - App logics.

# My Journey

What a coincidence! I have been working on this money management app on Union Government Budget Day (Feb 1)!

Putting my glorification of the coincidence aside, I started focusing on app development since I only had two days to complete the task. My journey began with designing the layout using Figma. Even though design is an easy job for me, I aimed for a simple design and focused purely on JavaScript development. I used online code snippets and modified them to match my taste. Once that was done, I quickly fixed the responsiveness, which became an easy task for me since I have started using Tailwind CSS more often for development.

Initially, I focused on adding functionality by storing values to dedicated variables. Once that was done with the help of the event listener, I updated the collected information dynamically to the table and append it. I came across multiple errors, undefined values, and many others... ChatGPT helped me resolve them ðŸ˜’. Now I am able to write 80% correct code and hopefully, I will increase it gradually!

Then, I completed the delete functionality, which was easy with the ".remove()" method. The progress was smooth until I started focusing on editing and updating the stored data. I encountered multiple issues, and then I needed to focus on local storage as well! I didn't even have any clue about local storage. With instructions and help from ChatGPT, I achieved the update functionality!

The key here is that relying on ChatGPT for solutions is not ideal and sometimes that totally messes up the code, but it helps us complete the project. With an understanding of the programming language we are using, we can leverage AI, but it's not as smart as exaggerated on social media.

# How It Works?

Two use cases, 
1st use case: who have used the application before and 
2nd use case: who landed for first time or who deleted the flow history. 

For 2nd use case we show empty field with message saying "Start managing your money!" and once they added a flow they will see table!
For 1st use case they will have table loaded from local memory.

Both users can able to edit the history, update it infinity times and delete it if they prefer to.
